## Installation

1. Install Truffle globally.
    ```javascript
    npm install -g truffle
    ```

2. Run the `liteserver` development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
    npm run dev
